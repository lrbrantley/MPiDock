** Using the Scheduler **
*************************

1. Starting the scheduler.
   A. "./scheduler.py" // Execute it as if it were a bash script.


** Scheduler Menu **
There are 5 options.

1. List existing jobs. This shows what jobs are currently listed as scheduled. 
   A. NOTE: This relies on a file called "scheduledjobs.txt" in the same
            directory as "scheduler.py". Only jobs mentioned in that file are
            listable, even if jobs are already in the "crontab".

2. Creating a new job.
   A. First, input a desired start time (24 hour clock, 0 is midnight).
   B. Second, input the location of the bash script you want to run at that time.
      i.    Placing an absolute path (starting with "~" or "/") is recommended.
   C. That's it. The newly updated list of existing jobs should then be printed.
      i.    Your script will now run at the specified time.

3. Deleting an existing job.
   A. Choose a job you want to delete by entering in the NUMBER of the job,
      not the name of the job.
   B. You should see an updated list of the current jobs after deleting.

4. Modifying an existing job.
   A. Choose a job you want to modify by entering in the NUMBER of the job,
      not the name of the job.
   B. You can modify the Start time or the Job location.
      i.    Choose an option from the screen.
      ii.   Enter your modification.
