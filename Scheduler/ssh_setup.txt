////////////////////////////
// SETTING UP SSH ALIASES //
////////////////////////////

1. Make a folder within your home directory named ".ssh"
   A. "mkdir ~/.ssh"

2. Go into the ".ssh" directory and make a file named "config".
   A. "cd ~/.ssh"
   B. "touch config"

3. In the config file, place in your desired ssh alias.
   A. The format for an alias is as follows.
      i.    "Host [your alias]
                 HostName [the ssh address]
                 User [your username]"
      ex:   "Host javalab
                 HostName 127x20.csc.calpoly.edu
                 User dli28"
   B. Open the "config" file with your favorite editor and place in your ssh alias. 

4. Test out the alias. You should now be able to connect to your old connection
   point by typing in "ssh [your alias]" rather than the entire ssh address.

/////////////////////////
// SETTING UP SSH KEYS //
/////////////////////////

1. Navigate to your ssh folder.
   A. "cd ~/.ssh"

2. Generate a pair of private and public ssh keys.
   A. "ssh-keygen" // run this command
      i.    Press enter when it asks you to where to save the key.
            The default location of "~/.ssh/id_rsa" works well, unless
            you already have a different key there.
      ii.   Press enter when it asks for a passphrase.
      iii.  Press enter when it asks for a confirmation of the passphrase.
   B. You should see a file named "id_rsa" and "id_rsa.pub" in "~/.ssh" now.

3. Add the public key to the list of authorized keys on the remote server
   so that you don't have to enter in your password.
   A. Make sure the remote host has a ".ssh" directory.
      i.    If not, make it.
   B. Copy over your public key to the remote host.
      i.    "scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub [your alias]:~/.ssh/my_id_rsa.pub" // run this cmd.
   C. On the REMOTE host, add the public key to the list of authorized keys.
      i.    "ssh [your alias]" // go to the remote host
      ii.   "cd ~/.ssh" // MAKE SURE THIS IS ON THE REMOTE HOST
      iii.  "cat my_id_rsa.pub >> authorized_keys" // MAKE SURE THIS IS ON THE REMOTE HOST.

4. Check the ssh key setup.
   A. Log out of the remote host if you haven't already.
   B. Attempt to ssh to the remote host.
      i.    "ssh [your alias]" should work without needing to enter in a password now.
