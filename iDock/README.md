idock
=====

idock is a standalone tool for structure-based [virtual screening] powered by fast and flexible ligand docking. It was inspired by [AutoDock Vina], and is hosted on GitHub at https://GitHub.com/HongjianLi/idock under [Apache License 2.0]. idock is also available as a web server at [istar].


Features
--------

* idock invents a lightweight and efficient io service pool to reuse threads and maintain a high CPU utilization throughout the entire docking procedure.
* idock recognizes as many as 28 chemical elements, i.e. H, C, N, O, S, Se, P, F, Cl, Br, I, Zn, Fe, Mg, Ca, Mn, Cu, Na, K, Hg, Ni, Co, Cd, As, Sr, U, Cs, Mo.
* idock outputs atomwise free energy values for subsequent identification of intermolecular interaction hotspots.
* idock writes the scores of each predicted conformation into a CSV file for subsequent sorting and analysis.
* idock provides precompiled 64-bit executables for Linux, Mac and Windows.


Supported operating systems and compilers
-----------------------------------------

* Linux x86_64 and clang 3.9.1
* Mac OS X x86_64 and darwin 4.2.1
* Windows x64 and Visual Studio 2015 Update 1

Pre-built 64-bit executables can be found in the `bin` directory. The executable was statically compiled for Linux and Windows, and dynamically compiled for Mac OS X.


Compilation from source code
----------------------------

idock depends on the [Boost C++ Libraries]. The Boost libraries required by idock are `System`, `Filesystem`, `Program Options` and `Thread`. Boost 1.60.0 was tested.

### Compilation on Linux

The Makefile uses clang as the default compiler. To compile, simply run

    make

One may modify the Makefile to use a different compiler or different compilation options.

The generated objects will be placed in the `obj` folder, and the generated executable will be placed in the `bin` folder.

### Compilation on Windows

Visual Studio 2015 solution and project files are provided. To compile, simply run

    msbuild /t:Build /p:Configuration=Release

Or one may open `idock.sln` in Visual Studio 2015 and do a full rebuild.

The generated objects will be placed in the `obj` folder, and the generated executable will be placed in the `bin` folder.


Usage
-----

First add idock to the PATH environment variable.

To display a full list of available options, simply run the program without arguments

    idock

The `examples` folder contains several use cases. For example, to dock the ligand TMC278 against HIV-1 RT of PDB ID 2ZD1,

    cd examples/2ZD1/T27

One can supply the options from command line arguments

    idock --receptor ../../../receptors/2ZD1.pdbqt --ligand ../../../ligands/T27 --center_x 49.712 --center_y -28.923 --center_z 36.824 --size_x 18 --size_y 18 --size_z 20

Or one can instruct idock to load the options from a configuration file

    idock --config idock.conf


Documentation
-------------

Documentations in both HTML and LaTeX formats can be esaily created by running [doxygen]

    doxygen idock.dox

The created documents will be placed in `doc` folder. To compile LaTeX files into PDF, one must have `pdflatex` installed.

    cd doc/latex
    make

The generated PDF will be `refman.pdf`.
